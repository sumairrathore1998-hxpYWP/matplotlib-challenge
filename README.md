FORGOT TO ADD THE ANALYSIS TO THE FILE, SO HERE IT IS:
In this experiment, a total of 248 mice were screened for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 
According to the data over this period, Capomulin seemed to be the most effective pharmaceutical treatment in dealing with the size of the tumour.  
Compared to the other medicines, mice who took Capomulin, had a much smaller tumour volume on average. 
According to the data provided, Capomulin made the tumour at least 20% smaller than any other medicine.
